# Phase 15 — Notes & Known Limitations

## Phase 15.1 — Smoke Tests Runtime Contract

### Known Limitation: verify_jwt=true Functions

For Edge Functions with `verify_jwt = true` in `supabase/config.toml`:

- **401 errors are generated by Supabase Edge Gateway** before reaching function code
- These errors do **NOT** pass through `runtime.ts`
- Therefore:
  - ❌ No `correlation_id` in response
  - ❌ No structured `error.code` (AUTH_MISSING_JWT, etc.)
  - ❌ No `runtime_events` logged

**This is expected and correct behavior.**

### Runtime Contract Guarantee

The Phase 14 Runtime Contract is guaranteed **only after successful JWT verification**:

| Function | verify_jwt | Runtime Contract on 401 |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| commit-decision | true | ❌ Not applicable |
| generate-case-outputs | true | ❌ Not applicable |
| generate-quotation-pdf | true | ❌ Not applicable |
| generate-quotation | false | ✅ Full contract |
| generate-response | false | ✅ Full contract |

### Rationale

1. `verify_jwt=true` is an **infrastructure-level** security gate
2. Migrating all functions to `verify_jwt=false` would be:
   - A major architectural change
   - A potential security risk
   - Out of scope for Phase 15.1
3. The smoke tests validate **application-level** behavior, not infrastructure rejection

### Test Strategy

Phase 15.1 smoke tests adapt expectations based on function configuration:
- **AUTH tests for verify_jwt=true**: Validate only `status === 401`
- **All other tests**: Validate full runtime contract (correlation_id, error.code, ok flag)

## Function Configuration Reference

```toml
# Functions with verify_jwt = true (Gateway-level auth)
[functions.commit-decision]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.generate-case-outputs]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.generate-quotation-pdf]
verify_jwt = true

# Functions with verify_jwt = false (Application-level auth)
[functions.generate-quotation]
verify_jwt = false

[functions.generate-response]
verify_jwt = false
```
